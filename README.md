## Insights:
1. Age 40–50 and 50–60 have the highest number of people in the High risk category.
2. Youngest and oldest groups show fewer high-risk individuals 
3. Medium risk is the most common across all age groups:
4.Males have slightly higher chances to be in  High risk category.
5. Students have the highest proportion of high-risk cases.
6. Self-employed individuals have the highest proportion of Low risk
7.On-site work environments may need more mental health interventions and support.
8. Higher proportion of people do not seeks treatment even after having Mental Health History.
9. Higher proportion of people do not seeks treatment even after having Mental Health Risk.

11.This dataset suggests sleep duration alone may not strongly predict stress level.
12. As mental health risk increases, average productivity decreases significantly.
13.Most of the people have higher chances of having medium Mental Health Risk.
